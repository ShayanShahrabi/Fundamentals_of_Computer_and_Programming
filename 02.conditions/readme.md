### C++ Programming Basics: `if` Syntax

---

#### 1. Introduction to `if` Statements
The `if` statement in C++ is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. It is a fundamental control structure that allows you to make decisions in your code.

---

#### 2. Basic `if` Syntax

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```
- `condition`: An expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- If the `condition` is true, the code inside the braces `{}` is executed.
- If the `condition` is false, the code inside the braces is skipped.

#### 3. `if-else` Syntax
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```
- The `else` block is optional and runs only if the `condition` is false.

---

#### 4. `if-else if-else` Syntax
```cpp
if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```
- You can chain multiple `else if` statements to check several conditions.
- The `else` block is optional and runs if none of the conditions are true.

#### 5. Example Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 10;

    // Simple if statement
    if (num > 0) {
        cout << "The number is positive." << endl;
    }

    // if-else statement
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        cout << "The number is even." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The number is odd." << endl;
    }

    // if-else if-else statement
    if (num > 0) {
        cout << "The number is positive." << endl;
    } else if (num < 0) {
        cout << "The number is negative." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The number is zero." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### 6. Conclusion
The if statement is a fundamental control structure in C++ that allows you to control the flow of your program based on conditions. Understanding its syntax and usage is essential for making decisions in your code
